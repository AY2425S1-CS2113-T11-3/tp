## Project: CliRental

**CLiRental** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application tailored for car rental businesses, 
providing an efficient solution for managing customers, cars, and rental transactions in a centralized, 
user-friendly platform. Targeted at car rental managers who often deal with large volumes of data, 
**CLiRental** replaces traditional, inefficient pen-and-paper methods with a fast, reliable, and straightforward desktop tool. 
Developed in Java with approximately 4,000 lines of code (LOC), this application is built to handle the core needs of a car rental operation, 
enabling managers to perform quick data entries and track essential business operations seamlessly.

## Summary of Contributions

### <u>Features additions and enhancements</u>

#### 1. Help Command Implementation
- Develop a user-friendly `help` command that provides a complete list of available commands with descriptions.
- This feature improves usability, especially for new users or those needing a quick reference to the systemâ€™s capabilities.

#### 2. Remove a Car
- Implement the feature to remove a car from the system, streamlining the process of updating the car inventory.
- Allows front-desk employees and managers to maintain an accurate fleet, ensuring only available cars are listed.

#### 3. Add Car with Statistical Calculations
- Enhance the `add-car` feature with additional statistical capabilities:
  - **Median Price Calculation**: After adding a car, the system calculates the median price of all available cars, offering insights into the pricing distribution.
  - **Price Category Listing**: Lists cars based on predefined price categories (e.g., affordable, expensive), allowing customers and employees to filter and select cars based on budget preferences.

#### 4. Enhanced Transaction Constraints
- Modifies the Customer, Car, and Transaction classes to enforce strict constraints:
  - **1-1 Relationship**: Ensured each customer can only rent one car at a time, forming a one-to-one relationship in each transaction.
  - **Transaction Validation**: Added checks to prevent adding new transactions involving either a customer or car already engaged in an active rental. New transactions can only be added if the previous one is marked as complete or deleted.
- This enhancement provides better data integrity and prevents conflicts, ensuring smooth transaction management and minimizing errors.

#### 5. Remove-All Commands
- Implement `remove-all` commands for various data entities, including customers, cars, and transactions:
  - **Remove All Customers**: Clears all customer records, useful for data resets or cleanup.
  - **Remove All Cars**: Deletes all cars from the inventory, streamlining fleet management when a complete update is needed.
  - **Remove All Transactions**: Wipes the transaction history, allowing administrators to clear old data or prepare for a new cycle.
- These commands enhance administrative control over data management, making it simple to clear outdated or unnecessary records efficiently.

#### 6. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- Update and expand test cases for each implemented feature, aiming for high coverage.
- These tests validate the reliability of each feature under various conditions, ensuring edge cases are accounted for and the system performs as expected in real-world scenarios.

Each of these contributions enhances the system's functionality, usability, and reliability, providing significant value to both users and administrators.
