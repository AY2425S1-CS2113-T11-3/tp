## Summary of Contributions

### <u>Features Added</u>

**Feature 1** : Implement Transaction Management Commands

- **What it does** : Introduces commands to manage rental transactions, including removing transactions, marking them as complete or incomplete, listing completed or uncompleted transactions, and finding transactions by customer.

- **Justification**: Efficient transaction management is crucial for tracking the status of rentals, ensuring cars are available when needed, and maintaining accurate records for billing and reporting purposes.

- **Highlights**:
    - **remove-tx**: Allows users to delete specific transactions using the transaction ID.
    - **mark-tx**: Enables marking a transaction as completed, indicating the rental period has ended.
    - **unmark-tx**: Allows users to revert a transaction's status to incomplete if needed.
    - **list-tx-completed**: Lists all transactions that have been marked as completed.
    - **list-tx-uncompleted**: Displays all transactions that are still active or incomplete.
    - **find-tx-by-customer**: Provides the ability to search for all transactions associated with a specific customer.

**Feature 2** : Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests for Transaction Classes

- **What it does** : Implements JUnit tests for all methods within the `Transaction` and `TransactionList` classes to ensure functionality and reliability.

- **Justification**: Unit testing is essential for verifying that individual components of the application work as intended, facilitating maintenance, and preventing regressions during future development.

- **Highlights**:
    - **Transaction Class Tests**: Tests cover methods such as adding, removing, marking, and unmarking transactions, ensuring each function behaves correctly under various scenarios.
    - **TransactionList Class Tests**: Verifies the integrity of the transaction list operations, including data consistency and correct handling of edge cases.
    - **Automated Testing**: Integrates tests into the development workflow, enabling continuous verification of code changes and enhancing overall code quality.
